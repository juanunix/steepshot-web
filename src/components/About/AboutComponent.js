                <p>We encourage you to follow simple rules when publishing:</p>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Quality. </strong>
                      All published images should be of high quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Repulsive content. </strong>
                      Your content should not be perceived as repulsive and shocking.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Hate Speech or Internet Trolling. </strong>
                      Publications should not incite hatred and be directed against a social group. Also, one should not publish calls for violence or terrorism.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Authorship. </strong>
                      It is undesirable to publish something that has no attributes of authorship. For example, a screenshot of the phone screen.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Fraud and plagiarizm </strong>
                      is not allowed. You should not publish requests for the transfer of money (for any reason) and negative media (messages in the spirit of "repay it, or it will happen terrible").</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>NSFW. </strong>
                      All adult content must be marked by the author by the
                      <strong> #nsfw tag. </strong>
                      Publication of pornographic content is not allowed.</li>
                    <li>If you have doubts about your content, refrain from publishing.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We expect users to downvote the content that does not follow the rules mentioned above and allow ourselves to hide it.</p>
